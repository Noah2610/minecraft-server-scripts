# Minecraft Server Scripts

Check out the scripts in `bin/`.  
If the file names aren't explanatory enough,
the first couple lines for each script have some more info.  
None of the scripts take arguments, all settings are given in the `config.env` file.  
You can check out the example config in `config.example.env`.  

You need to manually install a minecraft server in the same directory as this repository.

## TODO
- [ ] Write proper README!
- [ ] List dependencies.
- [ ] Properly kill resourcepack server when `bin/kill-server` is run.
- [ ] Make game server port configurable.
